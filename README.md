# .Hitman²
".Hitman²" is a remade of ".Hitman" with new functionalities, fewer bugs, and a better UI.
".Hitman" allows the user to shut down his computer in x seconds using an easy-to-use interface. It uses the shutdown.exe functionality from Windows. The first version would only allow for shut down. ".Hitman²" will use the full range of functionality from shutdown.exe by allowing users to shut down, restart or put their computer under hibernation. Plus, the range widened from 1 day 2 hours, and 0 minutes long to approximately 29 years. (Limitation from the 30 years max period of shutdown.exe)
Originally build in C# using .NET, ".Hitman²" is now built using C++ and the Ultra App Kit framework.

This project was built for fun and to learn/mess around with the Ultra App Kit framework.
